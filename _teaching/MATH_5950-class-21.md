This course will consider various recently defined graph parameters that can be viewed as the result of playing different games on graphs, e.g., the cop number of a graph (which comes from the game of cops and robbers on graphs), the burn number, power domination number, and the standard and several variations of the zero forcing number of a graph.

Goals: To synthesize previous work in the various areas of mathematics with the goal of putting the areas in a historical perspective and of relating them to the question of what makes up mathematics.

Content: Graph theory, matrix theory, combinatorics, various recently defined graph parameters
