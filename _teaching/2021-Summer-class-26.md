Goals: To help students integrate the knowledge and skills attained in the Computational Data Science program.

Content: Students will propose, execute, provide feedback on, and communicate about projects that are grounded in their disciplinary courses (the three courses they took that count toward another minor) but have a clear computational data science approach.
