Introduction to Mathematical Modeling is a mathematical tool for solving real world problems. In this course, students study a problem-solving process. They learn how to identify a problem, construct or select appropriate models, figure out what data needs to be collected, test the validity of a model, calculate solutions and implement the model. Emphasis lies on model construction in order to promote student creativity and demonstrate the link between theoretical mathematics and real world applications.
