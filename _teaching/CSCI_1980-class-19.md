This course introduces MATLAB as a programming language and as a software environment for mathematical computing and graphics. No prior use of MATLAB or computer programming is assumed. Topics will include: data input/output, plots, if-else statements, loops and vectorization, using built-in MATLAB functions, and creating your own scripts and functions that extend the language.

Goals: Demonstrate proficiency with the MATLAB environment, design and write programs in MATLAB, develop algorithmic thinking and writing computer programs as a problem solving tool.

Content: data input/output, plots, if-else statements, loops and vectorization, using built-in MATLAB functions, matrices and vectors
Prerequisite: Twelfth-grade high school mathematics with at least B grades or consent of instructor.
