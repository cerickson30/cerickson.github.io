<br>

Dr. Craig Erickson is a Visiting Lecturer in the Mathematics Department at Hamline University. Prior to joining the Hamline community in the fall of 2018, he was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa. Dr. Erickson teaches courses in both the Mathematics Department and the Computational Data Science program. His mathematical research interests include combinatorial matrix theory (the intersection of matrix theory and graph theory)---especially what the locations of the positive, zero, and negative entries in a matrix can say about various properties of matrices with that structure---and also problems related to the minimum rank and inverse eigenvalue problems for graphs. He is also interested in applying statistical and machine learning to a wide variety of problems and has both collaborated with Hamline students on data science summer research projects and has also provided statistical consulting on research projects in other departments.

**Teaching Style**

Whether it’s calculus, statistics, or computer programming, the best way to learn is by doing. With this philosophy, Dr. Erickson’s classes spend most of their time working and discussing examples. One of the wonderful things about mathematics and statistics is that we can find applications relevant to your interests, whatever you are majoring in, and so Dr. Erickson tries to learn his students’ interests so that he can include applications that will be of interest to each student. Dr. Erickson also recognizes that students bring a wide range of experiences and backgrounds to his classes and he works to meet students where they are and bring them all up to meet his rigorous standards.
