excerpt: 'Potentially eventually positive (PEP) sign patterns were introduced by Berman et al. (Electron. J. Linear Algebra 19 (2010), 108–120), where it was noted that a matrix is PEP if its positive part is primitive, and an example was given of a 3-by-3 PEP sign pattern with reducible positive part. We extend these results by constructing <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i> PEP sign patterns with reducible positive part, for every <i>n</i> ≥ 3 .'
