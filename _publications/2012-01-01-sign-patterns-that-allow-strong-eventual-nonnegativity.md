excerpt: 'A new class of sign patterns contained in the class of sign patterns that allow eventual nonnegativity is introduced and studied. A sign pattern is potentially strongly eventually nonnegative (PSEN) if there is a matrix with this sign pattern that is eventually nonnegative and has some power that is both nonnegative and irreducible. Using Perron-Frobenius theory and a matrix perturbation result, it is proved that a PSEN sign pattern is either potentially eventually positive or <i>r</i>-cyclic. The minimum number of positive entries in an <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i> PSEN sign pattern is shown to be <i>n</i>, and PSEN sign patterns of orders 2 and 3 are characterized.'

A new class of sign patterns contained in the class of sign patterns that allow eventual nonnegativity is introduced and studied. A sign pattern is potentially strongly eventually nonnegative (PSEN) if there is a matrix with this sign pattern that is eventually nonnegative and has some power that is both nonnegative and irreducible. Using Perron-Frobenius theory and a matrix perturbation result, it is proved that a PSEN sign pattern is either potentially eventually positive or <i>r</i>-cyclic. The minimum number of positive entries in an <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i> PSEN sign pattern is shown to be <i>n</i>, and PSEN sign patterns of orders 2 and 3 are characterized.
