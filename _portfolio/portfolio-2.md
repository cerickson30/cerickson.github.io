Interactive [Streamlit ![Streamlit icon](https://docs.streamlit.io/logo.svg)](https://streamlit.io/){:target="_blank"} app created by [Craig Erickson](https://cerickson30.github.io) to show county-level results of U.S. Presidential elections for 1960--2020, shading each county a color corresponding to the proportion of votes for the Democratic candidate, Republican candidate, and other candidates (or one other particular candidate if a third party candidate got a large proportion of votes). This required collecting and combining data from multiple sources.
